Their main task will be to provide information on the technical rules in use in other Member States.	xxx	xxx	Among these rules is the definite technical specification of the product, the emphasis on finding specific distinctions between similar products and the effort to protect in clearly specified circumstances the geographical indication.  The latter, however, usually does not have anything in common with the technical parameters of the product.  One of the aspects of the single market is the effort to avoid limiting the sale of products in another state's territory by imposing non-tariff barriers, such as quantitative restrictions, the obligation to repeat certification in each country, non-recognition of patents, specific packaging and labelling requirements of products outside common market customs, etc.  A first step, which could help to eliminate confusion or perhaps even artificial barriers to the free movement of goods, is raising awareness.

It is quite clear that it is an issue of equal opportunities and equal rights for men and women.

This Committee could be the appropriate forum to discuss a wide range of issues stemming from the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive.	xxx	xxx	At that time we came to the conclusion that these problems could be solved only if the Member States stepped up their mutual cooperation and, in particular, if they discharged their obligations concerning administrative cooperation and accessibility of information, as stipulated in the Directive.  Correct and effective implementation and enforcement are the key elements in the protection of the rights of posted workers, while insufficient enforcement weakens the effectiveness of the Community Directives in force in this area.  Consequently, on 3 April this year the Commission adopted a Recommendation on better cooperation in order to remedy the shortcomings in the implementation, application and enforcement of the existing Directive.  The Recommendation focuses in particular on better exchange of information, improving access to information and exchange of best practices.  Better administrative cooperation should therefore lead to greater protection of working conditions in practice, lower administrative burdens for companies, more effective monitoring of the discharge of existing obligations to observe working conditions, and provision of effective controls. The Recommendation also proposes the creation of a High-Level Committee that should directly involve the social partners, who are closest to the problems on the ground, and lay the basis for closer cooperation between labour inspectorates.

Both documents warn of the need to protect sport as a cultural value.	xxx	xxx	They were of course the first to understand what a purifying role sport can play in human culture.  Sport teaches us that people can compete with one another without causing harm, injury or even death; sport teaches fair play and offers everybody the same chances and the same rights.  But modern times have made sport into a business, a milieu pervaded by the negative influences that we already encounter almost everywhere: money, corruption, lobbying, racial prejudice and also the new phenomenon of various performance-enhancing drugs, factors that damage the integrity of sport and reduce the positive potential that sport has for bringing up young people or breaking down barriers between peoples and races.

I believe that in addition to this criticism, which also applies to the underestimation of the risks as regards the Member States' energy security- risks that are too high because an absolute fortune was dumped on the market without any safety mechanism ensuring that it would not end up in the wrong hands- some positive solutions must be provided, too. I think that the Agency should have the competences that would enable it to prevent electricity blackouts, and that the Commission should have the power to impose a price moratorium in case year-on-year average energy prices rise by more than 30% in all the Member States.

Since it may become a very significant phenomenon, we have to define, very carefully, what health tourism means.

Clearly, Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and the future Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 cover the vast majority of cases linked to tourism, but not health tourism.

The uncertainty could have led project managers to interrupt the running of operational programmes, which had to be avoided at all costs.	xxx	xxx	The reason for the change was to simplify administrative procedures.  The first actual operation carried out in accordance with Article 55 showed that there were serious difficulties with effective implementation.  These difficulties, as reported by the Member States, demonstrated that there was a lack of proportionality in the application of the procedures for setting the maximum eligible amount of the so-called 'funding gap' and in monitoring projects.  The aim of the amendment to the regulation in question is to exempt all operations cofinanced from the European Social Fund as well as small projects with overall costs of less than EUR 1 million cofinanced from the European Fund for Regional Development and the Cohesion Fund through the application of Article 55.  The decision to impose a ceiling of EUR 1 million arose from preliminary studies and was aimed at retaining the general nature of Article 55.  We hope that thanks to this simplification, which constitutes a form of 'de minimis' clause, we will be able to speed up the administration of funds for the Member States and their regions, especially in relation to the most innovative operations in areas such as research and support for renewable energy sources, etc. It was nevertheless important to avoid legal uncertainty, which would have unfairly delayed the payment process.

We are making progress in this direction and it is of course clear that even though we are not a member of UNESCO, there are surely ways of supporting this proposal.

Despite this, the Commission will continue in 2009 with cooperation in areas of common interest, especially in the fight against the drugs trade.	xxx	xxx	The search of the office is the latest in a series of acts of intimidation aimed at Mrs Ebadi which have included, for example, the closure in December of the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights, an organisation which she led.  The European Commission therefore fully supports the French Presidency of the Council of the Union in presenting two declarations regarding Mrs Ebadi's case on 31 and 22 December last year.  The Commission especially emphasises the fact that the Iranian authorities must comply with their international obligations in the human rights area and in particular the right of peaceful assembly set out in the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights. Iran has signed and ratified this Pact and hence it must allow the offices of the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights to be reopened and it must provide them with the legal status they have been requesting for many years.  In 2009, just as in the past, the Commission will not forego any opportunity to apply pressure on the Iranian authorities to provide protection for Mrs Ebadi and other human rights defenders (individuals or organisations) and to allow them to continue operating in the country without interfering in their legitimate activities. As you all know, the issues of nuclear power and human rights greatly limit the scope of our activities in Iran.	Despite this, the Commission will continue in 2009 with cooperation in areas of common interest, especially in the fight against the drugs trade. 	<	Comparison.Concession	Comparison.Concession

The challenge facing the international community in the following months is to support Guinea in its transition to democracy and in the arrangement of free and democratic elections for a law-making assembly and a president.	xxx	xxx	The European Commission wholeheartedly supports the declaration of the EU Presidency condemning this violent takeover of power and calling on the authorities in Guinea to return to civilian, constitutional and democratic government as quickly as possible.  The positive reception accorded to the military regime by the Guinean public, especially by political parties and trade unions, clearly shows that the standard of living for the Guinean people has deteriorated so much that even a military coup is viewed as a change for the better and as an event creating optimism for the future.  It also shows that the former regime had lost the trust of the Guinean people to such an extent that they preferred the government to be taken over by military units rather than official successors.  In this confused situation, it is important to welcome the rapid and effective initiatives undertaken by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and its chairman, Mr Chambas, as well as the determination and decisiveness of the Community and the African Union, which have suspended Guinea's membership in their organisations and have condemned the violent takeover of power. The Commission is determined to support the efforts of ECOWAS and the African Union and to support their efforts to enable the quickest possible return to a civilian, constitutional and democratic government through free and transparent elections.

In the report, the Commission spoke about why it is important to invest more in childcare facilities.	The Commission noted mainly that the Barcelona objectives are aimed at eliminating obstacles to accessing the labour market, especially for women. More than 6 million women in the EU (aged from 25 to 49) say that they are unable to work or can work only part-time because of family obligations.  The European economy is thereby deprived of significant productive potential, and this at a time when it must confront serious economic and demographic challenges, and when the social position of families is thereby weakened.	<	Expansion.Level-of-detail	Expansion.Level-of-detail

The main aim of the Council's draft proposal on patient safety and the quality of health care, including the prevention and control of hospital-acquired infections, is to define an integrated approach under which patients can transfer safely to high quality health care centres and where all factors having an impact on this will be taken into account.  This initiative arose based on findings of an alarming growth in the occurrence of adverse events throughout Europe, with hospital-acquired infections being among the most frequently-occurring adverse events.  This is a major challenge which is connected with the increasing expectations of the public in this area, the ageing population in Europe and the constant advances in medicine and medical science generally.

The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community. It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.

However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission's proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.  Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.  I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.

However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue.  Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice's verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies.

Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.  In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face. The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.	Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.

This is the purpose of these guidelines.	xxx	xxx	Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved- and I shall come back to this point presently- and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.  Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.  So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.  Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.  This means putting forward the Commission's priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.  The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.  When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels. And so, Mr SeppÃ¤nen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.	This is the purpose of these guidelines. 	<	Expansion.Level-of-detail	Expansion.Level-of-detail

Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union's structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.	xxx	xxx	I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.  The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.  In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.

We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.	xxx	xxx	Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?  Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.  It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.  So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.

europarl-fr-en-ep-00-01-18	xxx	xxx	The Commission suggests shorter deadlines.	I agree with this request.	xxx	xxx	As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.  Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.  This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.  This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.  It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.  In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.

It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.	xxx	xxx	But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.  In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.  The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.  Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.  Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.  Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing.

The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.  A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?  Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.  If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.  This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.	<	Contingency.Cause	Contingency.Cause

Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.  As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.  Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers. Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more."	This is no longer tolerable.

Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.	xxx	xxx	In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.  What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.  Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.  Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.  It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.

In this area we must respond to public opinion.	xxx	xxx	I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.  On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.  I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.  Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.  The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.  I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action. We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	In this area we must respond to public opinion. 	<	Contingency.Cause	Contingency.Cause

It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.  As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox.

The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.  According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned.

The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.  Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:  On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.  In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role ... in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.' So what was done at Amsterdam?	In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community's legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.

And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop.

A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic.	xxx	xxx	This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species.  What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie.  What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis.  I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs. These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.	A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic.

The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty.  However, I find these passports inadequate.	<	Contingency.Cause	Contingency.Cause

The very word bankruptcy, the legal concept of bankruptcy, does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union.  We therefore all agree on the established facts, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction.  If I may, however, just make a few comments on the method.  When you observe- and you cannot fail to do so- the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed.  The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany.

These aberrations should have remained confined to the British Isles, but doing away with borders within Europe has allowed adulterated chocolate to move freely, to the extent that today, in seven out of our fifteen countries, without being aware of it, consumers are swallowing chocolate that has been tampered with, and that includes Mr Haider's Austria which, in that respect, has something in common with Mr Guterres' Portugal.  In order to reassure us, we are told that the imitation cocoa is restricted to six tropical products: illipe from Borneo, butter from shea nuts- which are also used to manufacture aircraft engine oil- etc. As we go from directives to amendments, however, these six products become seven, eight, nine, up to and including soya, oilseed rape and GMOs.  We are also told that the cocoa fraud will be limited to 5% to begin with, then to 10%, not to mention that no check will ever be carried out, in the same way that, for example, the boxes of Chiquita bananas are not checked, which are supposed to weigh eighteen kilograms and in fact weigh twenty.

That is important to note. It is important at a time when the European Union is experiencing upheaval at its very centre.  It is important, too, and we would like to see this mentioned in the text that we are to vote upon tomorrow, at a time when we are involved in enlarging the Union to include countries for which the respect of fundamental rights is a significant question. It is important, finally, at a time when we consider- and we should like to specify this in the text that we shall be voting upon tomorrow- that the Union has passed the stage of economic integration and has clearly undertaken a process of political and social integration.  The charter must contribute to this.  The resolution on which we shall be voting tomorrow is certainly not intended to give a binding mandate to our fellow Members, myself included, in the context of the convention, since we have already commenced work.	<	Expansion.Level-of-detail	Expansion.Level-of-detail

europarl-fr-en-ep-00-03-14	xxx	xxx	Firstly, on the pretext of defending citizens better, it would distance them from the place where their rights are defined.	It would weaken the control that they currently have over it.	xxx	xxx	This report in fact proposes including the citizens' rights which have until now been determined at national level in a standard, detailed and binding European charter, whose application would be monitored and hence interpreted by the European Court of Justice.  I should point out, before going on, that I am not sure that all the other participants representing the Heads of State or Government and the national parliaments within the body established by the Cologne Council to prepare a preliminary draft charter are in fact in agreement with this position of the European Parliament.  So, for the time being, what I am about to say applies only to the Duff/Voggenhuber report.  Obviously, as far as those who promote the charter are concerned, defending fundamental rights which are already adequately protected in Europe at present, whatever they may say, is nothing but a pretext to conceal another, purely ideological, objective, which is to establish the beginnings of a European constitution, the crowning achievement of a superstate, even though the majority of the peoples of Europe do not want either of these.  And how right they are, for this detailed, mandatory charter, which would give standardised definitions of citizens' rights for the whole of Europe, would impose a rigid legal framework enclosing each nation in regulations which were not entirely its own.  There are three reasons for our claiming that the charter, as envisaged, would curtail the rights of citizens. Firstly, on the pretext of defending citizens better, it would distance them from the place where their rights are defined.	It would weaken the control that they currently have over it. It would end in a situation where a nation could no longer amend the rights of its own citizens without obtaining the agreement of fourteen other nations, a suffocating formula, ill-suited to the nature and the interests of Europe, as I explained in the minority opinion appended to the report.	<	Expansion.Conjunction	Expansion.Conjunction

Is it because of cut- throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri- foodstuffs industry?	xxx	xxx	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives. Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we can not just view this issue in terms of competition. You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission's scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin- loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil. We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals.

My concern is that the high calorific value waste will be cherry- picked for coincineration and this in turn will push up the cost of the specialist toxic waste incinerators which will mean that they will have to actually buy in fuel in many instances to achieve the high temperatures which are required to destroy things like dioxin.

With the decline of the 1987â1993 First Palestinian Intifada, the interim Oslo Accords led to the creation of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994, within the context of the Israeli â Palestinian peace process. The same year, Israel and Jordan reached a peace accord. In 2002, the Arab League offered recognition of Israel by Arab countries as part of the resolution of the Palestine â Israel conflict in the Arab Peace Initiative. The initiative, which has been reconfirmed since, calls for normalizing relations between the Arab League and Israel, in exchange for a full withdrawal by Israel from the occupied territories (including East Jerusalem) and a "" just settlement""of the Palestinian refugee problem based on UN Resolution 194.In 1990s and early 2000s, a cease- fire had been largely maintained between Israel and Baathist Syria, as well as with Lebanon. Despite the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan, the interim peace accords with the Palestinian Authority and the generally existing cease- fire, until the mid-2010s the Arab League and Israel had remained at odds with each other over many issues. Among Arab belligerents in the conflict, Iraq and Syria are the only states who have reached no formal peace accord or treaty with Israel, both however turning to support Iran. Developments in the course of the Syrian Civil War reshuffled the situation near Israel's northern border, putting the Syrian Arab Republic, Hezbollah and the Syrian opposition at odds with each other and complicating their relations with Israel, upon the emerging warfare with Iran."	The conflict between Israel and Hamas- ruled Gaza, is also attributed to the Iran â Israel proxy conflict in the region.

Responding to climate change involves mitigation and adaptation.	xxx	xxx	 Temperature rise on land is about twice the global average increase, leading to desert expansion and more common heat waves and wildfires. Increasing rates of evaporation cause more intense storms and weather extremes. Temperature rise is amplified in the Arctic, where it has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss. Additional warming also increases the risk of triggering critical thresholds called tipping points. Impacts on ecosystems include the relocation or extinction of many species as their environment changes, most immediately in coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic.

Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating.	xxx	xxx	 Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu- majority India and Muslim- majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence.
