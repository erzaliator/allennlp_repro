I knew that Mlle Swann used often to go and spend a few days at Laon; for all that it was many miles away, the distance was counterbalanced by the absence of any intervening obstacle, and when, on hot afternoons, I saw a breath of wind emerge from the furthest horizon, bowing the heads of the corn in distant fields, pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse, and finally come to rest, warm and rustling, among the clover and sainfoin at my feet, that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us together, to unite us; I would imagine that the same breath of wind had passed close to her, that it was some message from her that it was whispering to me, without my being able to understand it, and I would kiss it as it passed.	<	Expansion.Conjunction	Expansion.Conjunction

The reason given was that China would gain an inadequate advantage in its relations with other countries.	Is this not a manipulation of words?

This Committee could be the appropriate forum to discuss a wide range of issues stemming from the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive.	xxx	xxx	At that time we came to the conclusion that these problems could be solved only if the Member States stepped up their mutual cooperation and, in particular, if they discharged their obligations concerning administrative cooperation and accessibility of information, as stipulated in the Directive.  Correct and effective implementation and enforcement are the key elements in the protection of the rights of posted workers, while insufficient enforcement weakens the effectiveness of the Community Directives in force in this area.  Consequently, on 3 April this year the Commission adopted a Recommendation on better cooperation in order to remedy the shortcomings in the implementation, application and enforcement of the existing Directive.  The Recommendation focuses in particular on better exchange of information, improving access to information and exchange of best practices.  Better administrative cooperation should therefore lead to greater protection of working conditions in practice, lower administrative burdens for companies, more effective monitoring of the discharge of existing obligations to observe working conditions, and provision of effective controls.

I firmly believe that the social partners are in the best possible position to partake directly in such a change.  On the other hand, the Commission has its own enshrined right of initiative, and naturally the proposal for a directive was not submitted lightly; rather, it was based on an evaluation of the current situation and the experience to date.  The Commission will therefore not be held back by the conduct of the social partners.

europarl-cs-en-ep-08-05-08-004	xxx	xxx	Therefore I welcome the Commission's work on the White Paper on Sport and I value Mr Mavrommatis's report.	Both documents warn of the need to protect sport as a cultural value.	xxx	xxx	They were of course the first to understand what a purifying role sport can play in human culture.  Sport teaches us that people can compete with one another without causing harm, injury or even death; sport teaches fair play and offers everybody the same chances and the same rights.  But modern times have made sport into a business, a milieu pervaded by the negative influences that we already encounter almost everywhere: money, corruption, lobbying, racial prejudice and also the new phenomenon of various performance-enhancing drugs, factors that damage the integrity of sport and reduce the positive potential that sport has for bringing up young people or breaking down barriers between peoples and races. Therefore I welcome the Commission's work on the White Paper on Sport and I value Mr Mavrommatis's report.	Both documents warn of the need to protect sport as a cultural value. I would also personally like to emphasise even more the need to support sport at the amateur level too, to create the conditions needed for people to participate in recreational sporting activity, which is not easy, especially in large conurbations, as well as making it financially accessible, which is a limiting factor for the socially disadvantaged.

The uncertainty could have led project managers to interrupt the running of operational programmes, which had to be avoided at all costs.	xxx	xxx	The reason for the change was to simplify administrative procedures.  The first actual operation carried out in accordance with Article 55 showed that there were serious difficulties with effective implementation.  These difficulties, as reported by the Member States, demonstrated that there was a lack of proportionality in the application of the procedures for setting the maximum eligible amount of the so-called 'funding gap' and in monitoring projects.  The aim of the amendment to the regulation in question is to exempt all operations cofinanced from the European Social Fund as well as small projects with overall costs of less than EUR 1 million cofinanced from the European Fund for Regional Development and the Cohesion Fund through the application of Article 55.  The decision to impose a ceiling of EUR 1 million arose from preliminary studies and was aimed at retaining the general nature of Article 55.  We hope that thanks to this simplification, which constitutes a form of 'de minimis' clause, we will be able to speed up the administration of funds for the Member States and their regions, especially in relation to the most innovative operations in areas such as research and support for renewable energy sources, etc. It was nevertheless important to avoid legal uncertainty, which would have unfairly delayed the payment process.

It confirms the need for a strong and integrated maritime policy for the European Union, which the European Commission has been working on since 2005 and which emphasises the connections between regional policy, territorial cohesion and maritime policy.  In order to give the policy a concrete form, the Commission adopted in October 2007 the action plan for an integrated maritime policy, which is gradually being applied.  Some of the steps which the Commission is implementing at the moment are a direct reaction to the problems and demands expressed in the report, especially: 1) Based on the demands for full transparency in financing for the coastal regions a database of the projects supported from various Community funds will be created by the autumn of 2009.

Despite this, the Commission will continue in 2009 with cooperation in areas of common interest, especially in the fight against the drugs trade.	xxx	xxx	The search of the office is the latest in a series of acts of intimidation aimed at Mrs Ebadi which have included, for example, the closure in December of the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights, an organisation which she led.  The European Commission therefore fully supports the French Presidency of the Council of the Union in presenting two declarations regarding Mrs Ebadi's case on 31 and 22 December last year.  The Commission especially emphasises the fact that the Iranian authorities must comply with their international obligations in the human rights area and in particular the right of peaceful assembly set out in the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights. Iran has signed and ratified this Pact and hence it must allow the offices of the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights to be reopened and it must provide them with the legal status they have been requesting for many years.  In 2009, just as in the past, the Commission will not forego any opportunity to apply pressure on the Iranian authorities to provide protection for Mrs Ebadi and other human rights defenders (individuals or organisations) and to allow them to continue operating in the country without interfering in their legitimate activities.

The positive reception accorded to the military regime by the Guinean public, especially by political parties and trade unions, clearly shows that the standard of living for the Guinean people has deteriorated so much that even a military coup is viewed as a change for the better and as an event creating optimism for the future.  It also shows that the former regime had lost the trust of the Guinean people to such an extent that they preferred the government to be taken over by military units rather than official successors.  In this confused situation, it is important to welcome the rapid and effective initiatives undertaken by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and its chairman, Mr Chambas, as well as the determination and decisiveness of the Community and the African Union, which have suspended Guinea's membership in their organisations and have condemned the violent takeover of power.

The main aim of the Council's draft proposal on patient safety and the quality of health care, including the prevention and control of hospital-acquired infections, is to define an integrated approach under which patients can transfer safely to high quality health care centres and where all factors having an impact on this will be taken into account.  This initiative arose based on findings of an alarming growth in the occurrence of adverse events throughout Europe, with hospital-acquired infections being among the most frequently-occurring adverse events.  This is a major challenge which is connected with the increasing expectations of the public in this area, the ageing population in Europe and the constant advances in medicine and medical science generally.  Hospital acquired infections are also attracting ever more attention from the media and politicians. These were the reasons behind the decision of the Czech Presidency to organise the ministerial conference which took place in Prague on April 15-16 under the banner of 'Bacterial Threats to Patient Safety in Europe'.

The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.

To increase the effectiveness of individual measures the number of projects for URBAN II has been limited to 50.	xxx	xxx	The fact that this initiative will now be continued in the form of URBAN II, albeit with a smaller budget, is something for which we have to thank individual, committed Members of this Parliament, including in particular- as far as I have heard as a new Member of this Parliament- the rapporteur Mrs McCarthy, whom I should therefore like to thank very much for her dedication and of course also for her report on URBAN II.  A new feature of the URBAN II initiative is that it has been tailored to small cities or parts of cities.  This is important because it is precisely small cities which often find it harder to access aid. And yet the problems which give rise to the urgent need for regeneration can be particularly acute precisely in cities of this kind and thus have a proportionally adverse effect.	To increase the effectiveness of individual measures the number of projects for URBAN II has been limited to 50.

This is the purpose of these guidelines.	xxx	xxx	Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved- and I shall come back to this point presently- and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.  Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.  So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.  Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.  This means putting forward the Commission's priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.  The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.  When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels. And so, Mr SeppÃ¤nen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.	This is the purpose of these guidelines. 	<	Expansion.Level-of-detail	Expansion.Level-of-detail

Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union's structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.	xxx	xxx	I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.  The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.  In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.

Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.  It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.  So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.

I agree with this request.	xxx	xxx	As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.  Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.  This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.  This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.  It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.  In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.

It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.	xxx	xxx	But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.  In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.  The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.  Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.  Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.  Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing. But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.

The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.  A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?  Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.

Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.

Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area.

The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.  Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:  On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.  In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role ... in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.' So what was done at Amsterdam?	In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community's legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.

In this it said that in a few years' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances.	xxx	xxx	Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.  Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas. Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments.	In this it said that in a few years' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances. Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened.	<	Expansion.Level-of-detail	Expansion.Level-of-detail

The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community.

A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic.	xxx	xxx	This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species.  What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie.  What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis.  I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs. These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.

We can only applaud the proposed European directive which would make it possible to apply these principles.

europarl-fr-en-ep-00-03-14	xxx	xxx	Firstly, on the pretext of defending citizens better, it would distance them from the place where their rights are defined.	It would weaken the control that they currently have over it.	xxx	xxx	This report in fact proposes including the citizens' rights which have until now been determined at national level in a standard, detailed and binding European charter, whose application would be monitored and hence interpreted by the European Court of Justice.  I should point out, before going on, that I am not sure that all the other participants representing the Heads of State or Government and the national parliaments within the body established by the Cologne Council to prepare a preliminary draft charter are in fact in agreement with this position of the European Parliament.  So, for the time being, what I am about to say applies only to the Duff/Voggenhuber report.  Obviously, as far as those who promote the charter are concerned, defending fundamental rights which are already adequately protected in Europe at present, whatever they may say, is nothing but a pretext to conceal another, purely ideological, objective, which is to establish the beginnings of a European constitution, the crowning achievement of a superstate, even though the majority of the peoples of Europe do not want either of these.  And how right they are, for this detailed, mandatory charter, which would give standardised definitions of citizens' rights for the whole of Europe, would impose a rigid legal framework enclosing each nation in regulations which were not entirely its own.  There are three reasons for our claiming that the charter, as envisaged, would curtail the rights of citizens. Firstly, on the pretext of defending citizens better, it would distance them from the place where their rights are defined.	It would weaken the control that they currently have over it. It would end in a situation where a nation could no longer amend the rights of its own citizens without obtaining the agreement of fourteen other nations, a suffocating formula, ill-suited to the nature and the interests of Europe, as I explained in the minority opinion appended to the report.	<	Expansion.Conjunction	Expansion.Conjunction

However, we cannot support the proposal as it also aims to subject all plants to the same emission standards.

There are only three at the moment in the United Kingdom.	xxx	xxx	Mr President, I should like to make two brief points which may well be relevant should this go to conciliation, as I suspect it will. The first is the impact of this directive on the existing specialist toxic waste incineration industry. These incinerators have to adhere to higher standards than the coincineration plants. My concern is that the high calorific value waste will be cherry- picked for coincineration and this in turn will push up the cost of the specialist toxic waste incinerators which will mean that they will have to actually buy in fuel in many instances to achieve the high temperatures which are required to destroy things like dioxin. We need the specialist toxic waste incinerators.	There are only three at the moment in the United Kingdom. If we had fewer of these plants, it would mean that hazardous waste might well have to be transported for large distances, which is not acceptable for both political and practical environment reasons, and it would also push up the cost of incinerating this toxic waste.	<	Expansion.Instantiation	Expansion.Instantiation

These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome.	Leaving his command in Gaul would mean losing his immunity to criminal prosecution by his enemies; knowing this, Caesar openly defied the Senate's authority by crossing the Rubicon and marching towards Rome at the head of an army.

The Arctic Ocean includes the North Pole region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, and extends south to about 60 Â° N. The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by Eurasia and North America, and the borders follow topographic features; the Bering Strait on the Pacific side, and the Greenland Scotland Ridge on the Atlantic side.	It is mostly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities.	<	Expansion.Conjunction	Expansion.Conjunction
