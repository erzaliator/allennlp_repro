Thus , the sound of the word dog in English is connected to the concept ‘ dog ’ by historical accident and not by any natural connection ;

Frank Rack got in touch
[175, 14687, 16365, 1400, 1107, 2828]
But I am also happy to not go ,

But I am also happy to not go ,
[1133, 178, 1821, 1145, 2816, 1106, 1136, 1301, 117]
} Although I am sure right
[198, 1780, 178, 1821, 1612, 1268]

[198, 2062, 1159, 1110, 5865, 117, 2108, 1107, 22904, 1813, 11143, 1161, 117, 1268]
but it does n't require me to be there .
[1133, 1122, 1674, 183, 112, 189, 4752, 1143, 1106, 1129, 1175, 119]

if there are biologists
[1191, 1175, 1132, 24742, 1116]
they should have priority
[1152, 1431, 1138, 9830]
} These animals are shrouded in mystery . right
[198, 1292, 3551, 1132, 188, 8167, 13431, 1174, 1107, 8069, 119, 1268]
} Some of the most intriguing questions are chemical ; right
[198, 1199, 1104, 1103, 1211, 27529, 3243, 1132, 5297, 132, 1268]
Frank Rack got in touch
[175, 14687, 16365, 1400, 1107, 2828]
do they produce some kind of antifreeze ,
[1202, 1152, 3133, 1199, 1912, 1104, 2848, 26743, 3171, 117]

[1202, 1152, 3133, 1199, 1912, 1104, 2848, 26743, 3171, 117]
The samples we have are small in terms of numbers
[1103, 8025, 1195, 1138, 1132, 1353, 1107, 2538, 1104, 2849]

The samples we have are small in terms of numbers
[1103, 8025, 1195, 1138, 1132, 1353, 1107, 2538, 1104, 2849]
The formalin is great
[1103, 4698, 1394, 1110, 1632]
The formalin is great
[1103, 4698, 1394, 1110, 1632]
but for anemones , it prevents study of DNA or of the chemistry of the body .
[1133, 1111, 1126, 25027, 1279, 117, 1122, 17356, 2025, 1104, 173, 1605, 1137, 1104, 1103, 8117, 1104, 1103, 1404, 119]
This means we ca n't look at the issue <*> with these animals .
[1142, 2086, 1195, 11019, 183, 112, 189, 1440, 1120, 1103, 2486, 133, 115, 135, 1114, 1292, 3551, 119]
The formalin is great
[1103, 4698, 1394, 1110, 1632]
What we could do , however , was to study anatomy and figure out what it is ,
[1184, 1195, 1180, 1202, 117, 1649, 117, 1108, 1106, 2025, 19768, 1105, 2482, 1149, 1184, 1122, 1110, 117]

when we have samples
[1165, 1195, 1138, 8025]
when we have samples
[1165, 1195, 1138, 8025]
we can make precise comparisons ,
[1195, 1169, 1294, 10515, 21329, 117]
and figure out what these animals have or do
[1105, 2482, 1149, 1184, 1292, 3551, 1138, 1137, 1202]

[1105, 2482, 1149, 1184, 1292, 3551, 1138, 1137, 1202]
that lets them live
[1115, 11446, 1172, 1686]
} Just knowing a whole lot about a single species is n't very useful , right
[198, 1198, 3650, 170, 2006, 1974, 1164, 170, 1423, 1530, 1110, 183, 112, 189, 1304, 5616, 117, 1268]
} even if that animal is as special right
[198, 1256, 1191, 1115, 3724, 1110, 1112, 1957, 1268]
even if that animal is as special
[1256, 1191, 1115, 3724, 1110, 1112, 1957]
} - we need to know right
[198, 118, 1195, 1444, 1106, 1221, 1268]
do they produce some kind of antifreeze ,
[1202, 1152, 3133, 1199, 1912, 1104, 2848, 26743, 3171, 117]
what about them is different
[1184, 1164, 1172, 1110, 1472]
what about them is different
[1184, 1164, 1172, 1110, 1472]
The only way <*> is to make comparisons with close relatives .
[1103, 1178, 1236, 133, 115, 135, 1110, 1106, 1294, 21329, 1114, 1601, 8908, 119]
what about them is different
[1184, 1164, 1172, 1110, 1472]
We can start that side of the work now ,
[1195, 1169, 1838, 1115, 1334, 1104, 1103, 1250, 1208, 117]
} In terms of their glow , I suspect right
[198, 1107, 2538, 1104, 1147, 8656, 117, 178, 8095, 1268]
} that it 's not theirs right
[198, 1115, 1122, 112, 188, 1136, 19201, 1268]
} - although luminescence is common in anemone relatives , right
[198, 118, 1780, 181, 14088, 3965, 14797, 1110, 1887, 1107, 1126, 25027, 1162, 8908, 117, 1268]
that it 's not theirs
[1115, 1122, 112, 188, 1136, 19201]
do they produce some kind of antifreeze ,
[1202, 1152, 3133, 1199, 1912, 1104, 2848, 26743, 3171, 117]
They do make a host of florescent proteins ,
[1152, 1202, 1294, 170, 2989, 1104, 22593, 12238, 8298, 7865, 117]

Frank Rack got in touch
[175, 14687, 16365, 1400, 1107, 2828]
I used a dissecting scope
[178, 1215, 170, 4267, 11553, 16279, 9668]
to look at the animal 's external anatomy and overall body organization
[1106, 1440, 1120, 1103, 3724, 112, 188, 6298, 19768, 1105, 2905, 1404, 2369]

I used a dissecting scope
[178, 1215, 170, 4267, 11553, 16279, 9668]
and then looked at those slides under a compound microscope
[1105, 1173, 1350, 1120, 1343, 15766, 1223, 170, 7090, 17599, 15300]

[178, 1215, 170, 4267, 11553, 16279, 9668]
I used that same compound scope
[178, 1215, 1115, 1269, 7090, 9668]
I used that same compound scope
[178, 1215, 1115, 1269, 7090, 9668]
to see the stinging capsules
[1106, 1267, 1103, 25648, 21749, 1116]
I used a dissecting scope
[178, 1215, 170, 4267, 11553, 16279, 9668]
I compared the things <*> to what had been published on other species in this group .
[178, 3402, 1103, 1614, 133, 115, 135, 1106, 1184, 1125, 1151, 1502, 1113, 1168, 1530, 1107, 1142, 1372, 119]
} This step seems trivial , right
[198, 1142, 2585, 3093, 23594, 117, 1268]
I compared the things <*> to what had been published on other species in this group .

[198, 1105, 1108, 1682, 1106, 4959, 1268]
I figured out what group it belongs to ,
[178, 6101, 1149, 1184, 1372, 1122, 7017, 1106, 117]
} It was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication , right

Frank Rack got in touch
[175, 14687, 16365, 1400, 1107, 2828]
It was about two years from when Frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out .

Some of that time was just lost time
[1199, 1104, 1115, 1159, 1108, 1198, 1575, 1159]
- I had other projects in the queue
[118, 178, 1125, 1168, 3203, 1107, 1103, 15027, 4175]
} Once we figured out what it was , right

[1195, 1307, 170, 1974, 1104, 8323, 10632, 9235, 117]
which can be challenging and time consuming
[1134, 1169, 1129, 10467, 1105, 1159, 16114]

[1177, 1195, 1127, 1774, 1106, 1243, 1112, 1242, 1835, 1638, 1112, 1936, 119]

[2612, 1115, 112, 188, 1141, 1104, 1412, 2645, 1541, 117]
Cause that 's one of our problems really ,
[2612, 1115, 112, 188, 1141, 1104, 1412, 2645, 1541, 117]
It costs us so much money to for us to travel overseas and to compete internationally .
[1122, 4692, 1366, 1177, 1277, 1948, 1106, 1111, 1366, 1106, 3201, 7474, 1105, 1106, 4845, 7460, 119]
And so we can compete against each other all the time within Australia
[1105, 1177, 1195, 1169, 4845, 1222, 1296, 1168, 1155, 1103, 1159, 1439, 12686, 16468, 4567]

so it 's really important to be able to get as a many international trips throughout the year
[1177, 1122, 112, 188, 1541, 1696, 1106, 1129, 1682, 1106, 1243, 1112, 170, 1242, 1835, 9185, 2032, 1103, 1214]

But yes , Spitfire was good .
[1133, 4208, 117, 15277, 7117, 1108, 1363, 119]
We took quite a few new girls over there back then in 2005 ,

[1103, 23090, 1116, 1138, 1309, 1281, 1103, 1362, 2899, 119]

2002 World Cup , we won bronze .
[1617, 1362, 4355, 117, 1195, 1281, 4394, 119]
Then in 2006 we ended up fourth .
[1173, 1107, 1386, 1195, 2207, 1146, 2223, 119]
It was one of the worst World Cups <*> actually .

So I will mainly talk about how to use a representation theory
[1177, 178, 1209, 2871, 2037, 1164, 1293, 1106, 1329, 170, 6368, 2749]

} When I was ten right
[198, 1165, 178, 1108, 1995, 1268]
First of all because it was beautiful .
[1148, 1104, 1155, 1272, 1122, 1108, 2712, 119]
my father already showed me some stuff in mathematics
[1139, 1401, 1640, 2799, 1143, 1199, 4333, 1107, 6686]
First of all because it was beautiful .
[1148, 1104, 1155, 1272, 1122, 1108, 2712, 119]
} If you study physics or chemistry right
[198, 1191, 1128, 2025, 7094, 1137, 8117, 1268]
I also like the freedom in mathematics .
[178, 1145, 1176, 1103, 4438, 1107, 6686, 119]
then you should describe the real world .
[1173, 1128, 1431, 5594, 1103, 1842, 1362, 119]
But in mathematics you can build your own structures .
[1133, 1107, 6686, 1128, 1169, 3076, 1240, 1319, 4413, 119]
You can walk in worlds

You can walk in worlds
[1128, 1169, 2647, 1107, 11308]
It 's almost like God to some extent .
[1122, 112, 188, 1593, 1176, 5540, 1106, 1199, 6102, 119]
You can create worlds ,
[1128, 1169, 2561, 11308, 117]
} I think right
[198, 178, 1341, 1268]
First of all because it was beautiful .
[1148, 1104, 1155, 1272, 1122, 1108, 2712, 119]
} Many people , and many students , dislike math . right
[198, 1242, 1234, 117, 1105, 1242, 1651, 117, 20662, 12523, 119, 1268]
} Why do you think right
[198, 1725, 1202, 1128, 1341, 1268]
} it is so ? right
[198, 1122, 1110, 1177, 136, 1268]
} First of all I think right
[198, 1148, 1104, 1155, 178, 1341, 1268]
So I will mainly talk about how to use a representation theory
[1177, 178, 1209, 2871, 2037, 1164, 1293, 1106, 1329, 170, 6368, 2749]
maybe they have bad teachers ,
[2654, 1152, 1138, 2213, 4952, 117]
which is a problem .
[1134, 1110, 170, 2463, 119]
You have to have very good teachers in mathematics
[1128, 1138, 1106, 1138, 1304, 1363, 4952, 1107, 6686]
if you really want to enjoy
[1191, 1128, 1541, 1328, 1106, 5548]
maybe they have bad teachers ,
[2654, 1152, 1138, 2213, 4952, 117]
Probably some people mainly think about the scientific part of it
[1930, 1199, 1234, 2871, 1341, 1164, 1103, 3812, 1226, 1104, 1122]

maybe they have bad teachers ,
[2654, 1152, 1138, 2213, 4952, 117]
} Also <*> I notice right
[198, 1145, 133, 115, 135, 178, 4430, 1268]
} when I talk mathematics right
[198, 1165, 178, 2037, 6686, 1268]
} the language is very important in mathematics right
[198, 1103, 1846, 1110, 1304, 1696, 1107, 6686, 1268]
} and I actually notice right
[198, 1105, 178, 2140, 4430, 1268]
maybe they have bad teachers ,
[2654, 1152, 1138, 2213, 4952, 117]
} because they do n't know right
[198, 1272, 1152, 1202, 183, 112, 189, 1221, 1268]
that many times people fail in mathematics
[1115, 1242, 1551, 1234, 8693, 1107, 6686]
how to write a composition .
[1293, 1106, 3593, 170, 5239, 119]
They have ideas
[1152, 1138, 4133]
maybe they have bad teachers ,
[2654, 1152, 1138, 2213, 4952, 117]
Actually I find many connections between mathematics and literature
[2140, 178, 1525, 1242, 6984, 1206, 6686, 1105, 3783]
because almost all the thing <*> are also seen in literature and in writing
[1272, 1593, 1155, 1103, 1645, 133, 115, 135, 1132, 1145, 1562, 1107, 3783, 1105, 1107, 2269]

} when you write right
[198, 1165, 1128, 3593, 1268]
because <*> you can describe the real world ,
[1272, 133, 115, 135, 1128, 1169, 5594, 1103, 1842, 1362, 117]
but you can also create worlds of fiction .
[1133, 1128, 1169, 1145, 2561, 11308, 1104, 4211, 119]
So you have imagination ,
[1177, 1128, 1138, 10405, 117]
So you have imagination ,
[1177, 1128, 1138, 10405, 117]

[1272, 133, 115, 135, 1128, 1169, 5594, 1103, 1842, 1362, 117]
} So in a way people often do n't know right
[198, 1177, 1107, 170, 1236, 1234, 1510, 1202, 183, 112, 189, 1221, 1268]
Actually I find many connections between mathematics and literature
[2140, 178, 1525, 1242, 6984, 1206, 6686, 1105, 3783]
} It could look like almost the opposite : right
[198, 1122, 1180, 1440, 1176, 1593, 1103, 3714, 131, 1268]
Actually I find many connections between mathematics and literature
[2140, 178, 1525, 1242, 6984, 1206, 6686, 1105, 3783]
literature is kind of arts
[3783, 1110, 1912, 1104, 3959]
literature is kind of arts
[3783, 1110, 1912, 1104, 3959]
but they also see a lot in common
[1133, 1152, 1145, 1267, 170, 1974, 1107, 1887]
and there where mathematician
[1105, 1175, 1187, 13919]
and there where mathematician
[1105, 1175, 1187, 13919]
} You 're not only a mathematician . right
[198, 1128, 112, 1231, 1136, 1178, 170, 13919, 119, 1268]
You 're not only a mathematician .
[1128, 112, 1231, 1136, 1178, 170, 13919, 119]
} Why did you begin to write ? right
[198, 1725, 1225, 1128, 3295, 1106, 3593, 136, 1268]
} When I was quite young right
[198, 1165, 178, 1108, 2385, 1685, 1268]
} I was interested in psychoanalysis and in dreams . right
[198, 178, 1108, 3888, 1107, 15604, 21155, 23516, 17449, 4863, 1105, 1107, 6149, 119, 1268]
I was interested in psychoanalysis and in dreams .
[178, 1108, 3888, 1107, 15604, 21155, 23516, 17449, 4863, 1105, 1107, 6149, 119]
} I started to write down my dreams . right
[198, 178, 1408, 1106, 3593, 1205, 1139, 6149, 119, 1268]
} And then I noticed right
[198, 1105, 1173, 178, 3535, 1268]
I started to write down my dreams .
[178, 1408, 1106, 3593, 1205, 1139, 6149, 119]
that I cheat a little bit
[1115, 178, 28015, 170, 1376, 2113]
that I cheat a little bit
[1115, 178, 28015, 170, 1376, 2113]
Sometimes I make them more pretty
[2121, 178, 1294, 1172, 1167, 2785]
} So instead of documenting the dreams right
[198, 1177, 1939, 1104, 26678, 1103, 6149, 1268]
Sometimes I make them more pretty
[2121, 178, 1294, 1172, 1167, 2785]
} and I think right
[198, 1105, 178, 1341, 1268]
So I will mainly talk about how to use a representation theory
[1177, 178, 1209, 2871, 2037, 1164, 1293, 1106, 1329, 170, 6368, 2749]
} through writing my dreams right
[198, 1194, 2269, 1139, 6149, 1268]
} I 'm a little bit inspired by dreams right
[198, 178, 112, 182, 170, 1376, 2113, 3768, 1118, 6149, 1268]
that somehow <*> I gradually came to writing , also poems , but mainly stories .
[1115, 5006, 133, 115, 135, 178, 6044, 1338, 1106, 2269, 117, 1145, 6329, 117, 1133, 2871, 2801, 119]
} when eventually I started to write more seriously right
[198, 1165, 2028, 178, 1408, 1106, 3593, 1167, 5536, 1268]
} which also .. right
[198, 1134, 1145, 119, 119, 1268]
I was more interested in structure
[178, 1108, 1167, 3888, 1107, 2401]
but <*> I was more interested in structure
[1133, 133, 115, 135, 178, 1108, 1167, 3888, 1107, 2401]
for example my first book is called Opus 1 ..
[1111, 1859, 1139, 1148, 1520, 1110, 1270, 11769, 1361, 122, 119, 119]
for example my first book is called Opus 1 ..
[1111, 1859, 1139, 1148, 1520, 1110, 1270, 11769, 1361, 122, 119, 119]
The first part is called Legato
[1103, 1148, 1226, 1110, 1270, 3420, 10024]
The first part is called Legato
[1103, 1148, 1226, 1110, 1270, 3420, 10024]
} In the staccato part it 's like a music : right
[198, 1107, 1103, 188, 1777, 19495, 2430, 1226, 1122, 112, 188, 1176, 170, 1390, 131, 1268]
In the legato part the sentences are very long and without breaks almost like stream of consciousness .
[1107, 1103, 3420, 10024, 1226, 1103, 12043, 1132, 1304, 1263, 1105, 1443, 7610, 1593, 1176, 5118, 1104, 8418, 119]
for example my first book is called Opus 1 ..
[1111, 1859, 1139, 1148, 1520, 1110, 1270, 11769, 1361, 122, 119, 119]
} In the second book I made another experiment . right
[198, 1107, 1103, 1248, 1520, 178, 1189, 1330, 7886, 119, 1268]
for example my first book is called Opus 1 ..
[1111, 1859, 1139, 1148, 1520, 1110, 1270, 11769, 1361, 122, 119, 119]
It 's a book of opening ,
[1122, 112, 188, 170, 1520, 1104, 2280, 117]
It 's a book of opening ,
[1122, 112, 188, 170, 1520, 1104, 2280, 117]
and there is no end to the stories .
[1105, 1175, 1110, 1185, 1322, 1106, 1103, 2801, 119]
} In the novel Dark Matters <*> what interested me in the structure was two thing : right
[198, 1107, 1103, 2281, 1843, 5218, 133, 115, 135, 1184, 3888, 1143, 1107, 1103, 2401, 1108, 1160, 1645, 131, 1268]
} I think right
[198, 178, 1341, 1268]
for example my first book is called Opus 1 ..
[1111, 1859, 1139, 1148, 1520, 1110, 1270, 11769, 1361, 122, 119, 119]
simple narrative and email .
[3014, 8195, 1105, 10632, 119]
} Another thing was two different time scapes : right
[198, 1330, 1645, 1108, 1160, 1472, 1159, 188, 24517, 1116, 131, 1268]
simple narrative and email .
[3014, 8195, 1105, 10632, 119]
one goes very slow
[1141, 2947, 1304, 3345]
one goes very slow
[1141, 2947, 1304, 3345]
and they almost kind of meet in the end .
[1105, 1152, 1593, 1912, 1104, 2283, 1107, 1103, 1322, 119]
} ... love story and romance and surprises and tragedies and all this right
[198, 119, 119, 119, 1567, 1642, 1105, 9688, 1105, 22810, 1105, 189, 20240, 10831, 1105, 1155, 1142, 1268]
one goes very slow
[1141, 2947, 1304, 3345]
} Why did you choose this particular structure ? right
[198, 1725, 1225, 1128, 4835, 1142, 2440, 2401, 136, 1268]
} When I tell stories right
[198, 1165, 178, 1587, 2801, 1268]
So I will mainly talk about how to use a representation theory
[1177, 178, 1209, 2871, 2037, 1164, 1293, 1106, 1329, 170, 6368, 2749]
I do n't like that everything will be clear from the beginning .
[178, 1202, 183, 112, 189, 1176, 1115, 1917, 1209, 1129, 2330, 1121, 1103, 2150, 119]
} someone tells something right
[198, 1800, 3301, 1380, 1268]
I like that something will be a bit of secret , or even unreliable narrator :
[178, 1176, 1115, 1380, 1209, 1129, 170, 2113, 1104, 3318, 117, 1137, 1256, 26641, 12790, 131]
and first you trust him
[1105, 1148, 1128, 3496, 1140]
but then you read more
[1133, 1173, 1128, 2373, 1167]
} I think right
[198, 178, 1341, 1268]
I do n't like that everything will be clear from the beginning .
[178, 1202, 183, 112, 189, 1176, 1115, 1917, 1209, 1129, 2330, 1121, 1103, 2150, 119]
by using emails on the one hand
[1118, 1606, 24853, 1113, 1103, 1141, 1289]
by using emails on the one hand
[1118, 1606, 24853, 1113, 1103, 1141, 1289]
and narrative
[1105, 8195]
by using emails on the one hand
[1118, 1606, 24853, 1113, 1103, 1141, 1289]
by using emails on the one hand
[1118, 1606, 24853, 1113, 1103, 1141, 1289]
and then kind somehow you can see the distortions in the way
[1105, 1173, 1912, 5006, 1128, 1169, 1267, 1103, 25856, 1116, 1107, 1103, 1236]

Many books and articles in moral philosophy start with the observation <*> and the assumption
[1242, 2146, 1105, 4237, 1107, 7279, 5027, 1838, 1114, 1103, 8310, 133, 115, 135, 1105, 1103, 13457]
and the assumption
[1105, 1103, 13457]
} For example , Michael Smith writes : right
[198, 1111, 1859, 117, 1940, 7147, 1883, 188, 17740, 6474, 131, 1268]
} We seem to think right
[198, 1195, 3166, 1106, 1341, 1268]
Many books and articles in moral philosophy start with the observation <*> and the assumption

[198, 1118, 12368, 1107, 7279, 3771, 1105, 6171, 117, 1268]
moral questions have correct answers ;
[7279, 3243, 1138, 5663, 6615, 132]

[198, 1133, 133, 115, 135, 14745, 2749, 7155, 1268]
} as we have seen above , right
[198, 1112, 1195, 1138, 1562, 1807, 117, 1268]
} why we would think right
[198, 1725, 1195, 1156, 1341, 1268]
Many books and articles in moral philosophy start with the observation <*> and the assumption
[1242, 2146, 1105, 4237, 1107, 7279, 5027, 1838, 1114, 1103, 8310, 133, 115, 135, 1105, 1103, 13457]
} The philosopher Michael Ruse takes this right
[198, 1103, 10070, 1940, 7147, 1883, 187, 5613, 2274, 1142, 1268]
that moral judgments are objective .
[1115, 7279, 9228, 1116, 1132, 7649, 119]
to show that the apparent objectivity of morality is something like an “ illusion ”
[1106, 1437, 1115, 1103, 6281, 4231, 6366, 1104, 19613, 1110, 1380, 1176, 1126, 789, 14488, 790]

[1106, 1437, 1115, 1103, 6281, 4231, 6366, 1104, 19613, 1110, 1380, 1176, 1126, 789, 14488, 790]
} Of course , <*> this does not show that moral judgments are not objective , right
[198, 1104, 1736, 117, 133, 115, 135, 1142, 1674, 1136, 1437, 1115, 7279, 9228, 1116, 1132, 1136, 7649, 117, 1268]
} even if Ruse is correct , right
[198, 1256, 1191, 187, 5613, 1110, 5663, 117, 1268]
} but it can make us think right
[198, 1133, 1122, 1169, 1294, 1366, 1341, 1268]
that moral judgments are objective .
[1115, 7279, 9228, 1116, 1132, 7649, 119]
whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained ,
[2480, 1103, 4231, 6366, 1104, 19613, 1541, 1144, 1106, 1129, 3716, 117]
} Ruse has also argued right
[198, 187, 5613, 1144, 1145, 4491, 1268]
} that an evolutionary account of morality suggests right
[198, 1115, 1126, 14745, 3300, 1104, 19613, 5401, 1268]
that moral judgments are objective .
[1115, 7279, 9228, 1116, 1132, 7649, 119]
that there are no moral facts in the first place .
[1115, 1175, 1132, 1185, 7279, 9193, 1107, 1103, 1148, 1282, 119]
Anything <*> can be explained
[1625, 133, 115, 135, 1169, 1129, 3716]
can be explained
[1169, 1129, 3716]
Anything <*> can be explained
[1625, 133, 115, 135, 1169, 1129, 3716]
} If moral facts are explanatorily redundant , right
[198, 1191, 7279, 9193, 1132, 4252, 1643, 20592, 2772, 5264, 24520, 117, 1268]
} indeed , moral realists <*> need to say right
[198, 5750, 117, 7279, 1842, 3681, 133, 115, 135, 1444, 1106, 1474, 1268]

} who believe right
[198, 1150, 2059, 1268]
( those
[113, 1343]
there are mind-independent , objective facts about morality ,
[1175, 1132, 1713, 118, 2457, 117, 7649, 9193, 1164, 19613, 117]
} why we should still suppose right
[198, 1725, 1195, 1431, 1253, 6699, 1268]
that there are no moral facts in the first place .
[1115, 1175, 1132, 1185, 7279, 9193, 1107, 1103, 1148, 1282, 119]

Interestingly , Ruse ’s methodological naturalism leads him to embrace a view
[5426, 1193, 117, 187, 5613, 787, 188, 3442, 7542, 2379, 1863, 4501, 1140, 1106, 10249, 170, 2458]
that goes against the metaphysical naturalist position
[1115, 2947, 1222, 1103, 27154, 18547, 23439, 1700]
} Relatedly , Sharon Street , for example , argues right
[198, 2272, 1193, 117, 188, 7111, 1320, 2472, 117, 1111, 1859, 117, 8935, 1268]
} that evolutionary explanations of morality show right
[198, 1115, 14745, 19940, 1104, 19613, 1437, 1268]
} that moral realism is probably false . right
[198, 1115, 7279, 18990, 1110, 1930, 6014, 119, 1268]
that moral realism is probably false .
[1115, 7279, 18990, 1110, 1930, 6014, 119]
The kind of moral realism <*> is the view

[1111, 1199, 4817, 117, 14534, 13974, 1957, 2734, 119]
For example , it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota
[1111, 1859, 117, 1122, 1110, 5477, 1106, 1129, 170, 11773, 9230, 1107, 1564, 5358, 27952, 1161]

but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida
[1133, 5477, 1106, 1576, 170, 7798, 3415, 1107, 22593, 9012, 1810]
} If you live in or near a big city , right
[198, 1191, 1128, 1686, 1107, 1137, 1485, 170, 1992, 1331, 117, 1268]

it is easier to attract enough customers
[1122, 1110, 5477, 1106, 9781, 1536, 5793]
} Whatever the reason , right
[198, 3451, 1103, 2255, 117, 1268]
} if people specialize in the production right
[198, 1191, 1234, 1957, 3708, 1107, 1103, 1707, 1268]
if people specialize in the production
[1191, 1234, 1957, 3708, 1107, 1103, 1707]
First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process
[1148, 117, 1957, 2734, 1107, 170, 2440, 1353, 2261, 3643, 3239, 1106, 2817, 1113, 1103, 2192, 1104, 1103, 1707, 1965]
they will be more effective
[1152, 1209, 1129, 1167, 3903]
than if they produce a combination of things ,
[1190, 1191, 1152, 3133, 170, 4612, 1104, 1614, 117]
some of which they are good at
[1199, 1104, 1134, 1152, 1132, 1363, 1120]
First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process

Second , workers <*> often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality .
[1248, 117, 3239, 133, 115, 135, 1510, 3858, 1106, 3133, 1167, 1976, 1105, 1114, 2299, 3068, 119]

This pattern holds true for many workers ,
[1142, 4844, 3486, 2276, 1111, 1242, 3239, 117]
including assembly line laborers <*> stylists <*> and doctors
[1259, 5839, 1413, 27245, 133, 115, 135, 188, 2340, 18286, 133, 115, 135, 1105, 8114]
stylists
[188, 2340, 18286]
and doctors
[1105, 8114]
} In fact , specialized workers often know their jobs well enough right
[198, 1107, 1864, 117, 7623, 3239, 1510, 1221, 1147, 5448, 1218, 1536, 1268]

[1248, 117, 3239, 133, 115, 135, 1510, 3858, 1106, 3133, 1167, 1976, 1105, 1114, 2299, 3068, 119]
to suggest innovative ways
[1106, 5996, 10034, 3242]
} A similar pattern often operates within businesses . right
[198, 170, 1861, 4844, 1510, 5049, 1439, 5028, 119, 1268]

In many cases , a business <*> is more successful than firms
[1107, 1242, 2740, 117, 170, 1671, 133, 115, 135, 1110, 1167, 2265, 1190, 9780]
that focuses on one or a few products
[1115, 7203, 1113, 1141, 1137, 170, 1374, 2982]

Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale ,
[1503, 117, 1957, 2734, 3643, 5028, 1106, 1321, 4316, 1104, 21553, 1104, 3418, 117]
} as the level of production increases , right
[198, 1112, 1103, 1634, 1104, 1707, 6986, 117, 1268]
the average cost <*> declines .
[1103, 1903, 2616, 133, 115, 135, 6246, 1116, 119]
} For example , <*> each car will be quite expensive to make on average . right
[198, 1111, 1859, 117, 133, 115, 135, 1296, 1610, 1209, 1129, 2385, 5865, 1106, 1294, 1113, 1903, 119, 1268]
} if a factory produces only 100 cars per year , right
[198, 1191, 170, 4790, 6570, 1178, 1620, 3079, 1679, 1214, 117, 1268]
} However , right
[198, 1649, 117, 1268]
} if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year , right
[198, 1191, 170, 4790, 6570, 1851, 117, 1288, 3079, 1296, 1214, 117, 1268]
However ,
[1649, 117]
then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers
[1173, 1122, 1169, 1383, 1146, 1126, 5839, 1413, 1114, 3321, 6555, 1105, 3239]

The ultimate result of workers <*> is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more
[1103, 10010, 1871, 1104, 3239, 133, 115, 135, 1110, 1115, 2808, 1112, 170, 2006, 1169, 3133, 1105, 17914, 1677, 1167]

This is the I do n't know what to do with it pile ,
[1142, 1110, 1103, 178, 1202, 183, 112, 189, 1221, 1184, 1106, 1202, 1114, 1122, 8501, 117]

[198, 1177, 1107, 2052, 112, 188, 1888, 117, 178, 112, 182, 1921, 1301, 1179, 9468, 1129, 1833, 170, 1395, 2465, 119, 1268]
} I know right
[198, 178, 1221, 1268]
} this is something right
[198, 1142, 1110, 1380, 1268]
this is something
[1142, 1110, 1380]
} and after two and a half years <*> like I 've made it my own right
[198, 1105, 1170, 1160, 1105, 170, 1544, 1201, 133, 115, 135, 1176, 178, 112, 1396, 1189, 1122, 1139, 1319, 1268]
and after two and a half years <*> like I 've made it my own
[1105, 1170, 1160, 1105, 170, 1544, 1201, 133, 115, 135, 1176, 178, 112, 1396, 1189, 1122, 1139, 1319]
} I finally feel right
[198, 178, 1921, 1631, 1268]
like I 've made it my own
[1176, 178, 112, 1396, 1189, 1122, 1139, 1319]
and decorated it
[1105, 7038, 1122]
like I 've made it my own
[1176, 178, 112, 1396, 1189, 1122, 1139, 1319]
} Alright so let 's start off with the bed and the couch area . right
[198, 15354, 1177, 1519, 112, 188, 1838, 1228, 1114, 1103, 1908, 1105, 1103, 5943, 1298, 119, 1268]
} Honestly , <*> I would have really liked to have a double bed in this room , right
[198, 12051, 117, 133, 115, 135, 178, 1156, 1138, 1541, 3851, 1106, 1138, 170, 2702, 1908, 1107, 1142, 1395, 117, 1268]
} if I was redoing this from the beginning , right
[198, 1191, 178, 1108, 1894, 27371, 1142, 1121, 1103, 2150, 117, 1268]
} but , unfortunately , with the space <*> it 's basically just enough right
[198, 1133, 117, 16679, 117, 1114, 1103, 2000, 133, 115, 135, 1122, 112, 188, 11519, 1198, 1536, 1268]
} as you can probably see from that wall there till the door , right
[198, 1112, 1128, 1169, 1930, 1267, 1121, 1115, 2095, 1175, 6174, 1103, 1442, 117, 1268]
it 's basically just enough
[1122, 112, 188, 11519, 1198, 1536]
} I 've recently changed it , right
[198, 178, 112, 1396, 3055, 2014, 1122, 117, 1268]
and this is my couch over here .
[1105, 1142, 1110, 1139, 5943, 1166, 1303, 119]
} if you 've been following my channel for a long time , right
[198, 1191, 1128, 112, 1396, 1151, 1378, 1139, 3094, 1111, 170, 1263, 1159, 117, 1268]
} then you 'll know right
[198, 1173, 1128, 112, 1325, 1221, 1268]
and <*> I 'm really proud of how I color match the pictures on the wall over here with sort of the gray and yellow vibe , the gray and yellow cushions .
[1105, 133, 115, 135, 178, 112, 182, 1541, 6884, 1104, 1293, 178, 2942, 1801, 1103, 5324, 1113, 1103, 2095, 1166, 1303, 1114, 3271, 1104, 1103, 5021, 1105, 3431, 191, 13374, 117, 1103, 5021, 1105, 3431, 26701, 1116, 119]
This couch is also quite big ,
[1142, 5943, 1110, 1145, 2385, 1992, 117]
it fits three people quite comfortably ,
[1122, 17976, 1210, 1234, 2385, 20542, 117]
} if I have family or friends staying over , right
[198, 1191, 178, 1138, 1266, 1137, 2053, 6218, 1166, 117, 1268]
and this is my couch over here .
[1105, 1142, 1110, 1139, 5943, 1166, 1303, 119]
This coffee table over here , it 's glass
[1142, 3538, 1952, 1166, 1303, 117, 1122, 112, 188, 2525]
This coffee table over here , it 's glass
[1142, 3538, 1952, 1166, 1303, 117, 1122, 112, 188, 2525]
so it 's really good
[1177, 1122, 112, 188, 1541, 1363]
when we have multiple friends over ,
[1165, 1195, 1138, 2967, 2053, 1166, 117]
and we have lots of food
[1105, 1195, 1138, 7424, 1104, 2094]
so it 's really good
[1177, 1122, 112, 188, 1541, 1363]
} if we 're playing board games , right
[198, 1191, 1195, 112, 1231, 1773, 2313, 1638, 117, 1268]
or <*> we can have people sit around it ,
[1137, 133, 115, 135, 1195, 1169, 1138, 1234, 3465, 1213, 1122, 117]
and still have a lot of space
[1105, 1253, 1138, 170, 1974, 1104, 2000]
} So there 's nothing too special about the bed itself , right
[198, 1177, 1175, 112, 188, 1720, 1315, 1957, 1164, 1103, 1908, 2111, 117, 1268]
and this is my couch over here .
[1105, 1142, 1110, 1139, 5943, 1166, 1303, 119]
but it does have a very important function ,
[1133, 1122, 1674, 1138, 170, 1304, 1696, 3053, 117]
but it does have a very important function ,
[1133, 1122, 1674, 1138, 170, 1304, 1696, 3053, 117]
So down here is basically where I keep everything
[1177, 1205, 1303, 1110, 11519, 1187, 178, 1712, 1917]
that I ca n't really keep in my room ,
[1115, 178, 11019, 183, 112, 189, 1541, 1712, 1107, 1139, 1395, 117]
So down here is basically where I keep everything
[1177, 1205, 1303, 1110, 11519, 1187, 178, 1712, 1917]
I 've got an ironing board , all of my suitcases , socks , clothes <*> anything <*> like screwdrivers , drills , nails , all these things
[178, 112, 1396, 1400, 1126, 3926, 1158, 2313, 117, 1155, 1104, 1139, 17655, 1116, 117, 16601, 117, 3459, 133, 115, 135, 1625, 133, 115, 135, 1176, 13084, 23632, 25105, 117, 15227, 1116, 117, 10821, 117, 1155, 1292, 1614]
anything
[1625]
that I need
[1115, 178, 1444]
like screwdrivers , drills , nails , all these things
[1176, 13084, 23632, 25105, 117, 15227, 1116, 117, 10821, 117, 1155, 1292, 1614]
that I definitely would n't want to have laid out in my room ,
[1115, 178, 5397, 1156, 183, 112, 189, 1328, 1106, 1138, 3390, 1149, 1107, 1139, 1395, 117]
and this is my couch over here .
[1105, 1142, 1110, 1139, 5943, 1166, 1303, 119]
I love that this room has floor-to-ceiling windows as well ,
[178, 1567, 1115, 1142, 1395, 1144, 1837, 118, 1106, 118, 5265, 3751, 1112, 1218, 117]
} I know right
[198, 178, 1221, 1268]
} London does n't have that much light , right
[198, 25338, 17996, 1674, 183, 112, 189, 1138, 1115, 1277, 1609, 117, 1268]
I love that this room has floor-to-ceiling windows as well ,
[178, 1567, 1115, 1142, 1395, 1144, 1837, 118, 1106, 118, 5265, 3751, 1112, 1218, 117]
but I 'll take as much
[1133, 178, 112, 1325, 1321, 1112, 1277]
but I 'll take as much
[1133, 178, 112, 1325, 1321, 1112, 1277]
and there 's also a small balcony out here ,
[1105, 1175, 112, 188, 1145, 170, 1353, 12025, 1149, 1303, 117]
and there 's also a small balcony out here ,
[1105, 1175, 112, 188, 1145, 170, 1353, 12025, 1149, 1303, 117]
We have two chairs
[1195, 1138, 1160, 8391]
where we can sit down
[1187, 1195, 1169, 3465, 1205]
and sort of enjoy the weather
[1105, 3271, 1104, 5548, 1103, 4250]
We have two chairs
[1195, 1138, 1160, 8391]
um but now it 's really cold
[15276, 1133, 1208, 1122, 112, 188, 1541, 2504]
and this is my couch over here .
[1105, 1142, 1110, 1139, 5943, 1166, 1303, 119]
And then a little behind the scenes <*> is that down here I keep all of the filming gear
[1105, 1173, 170, 1376, 1481, 1103, 4429, 133, 115, 135, 1110, 1115, 1205, 1303, 178, 1712, 1155, 1104, 1103, 7973, 6990]

two sets of tripods ,
[1160, 3741, 1104, 3868, 16476, 117]

and this has actually changed my life .
[1105, 1142, 1144, 2140, 2014, 1139, 1297, 119]
It makes waking up in the morning and getting out of bed at 6:00 a.m. <*> so much easier
[1122, 2228, 14047, 1146, 1107, 1103, 2106, 1105, 2033, 1149, 1104, 1908, 1120, 127, 131, 3135, 170, 119, 182, 119, 133, 115, 135, 1177, 1277, 5477]

and this has actually changed my life .
[1105, 1142, 1144, 2140, 2014, 1139, 1297, 119]
It 's so much better to wake up to the sound
[1122, 112, 188, 1177, 1277, 1618, 1106, 5314, 1146, 1106, 1103, 1839]

and this is my couch over here .
[1105, 1142, 1110, 1139, 5943, 1166, 1303, 119]
Over here on the wall , these are posters

[1166, 1303, 1113, 1103, 2095, 117, 1292, 1132, 16300]

[1105, 178, 1541, 1541, 3851, 1172]
} Also I 'm really proud right
[198, 1145, 178, 112, 182, 1541, 6884, 1268]
Over here on the wall , these are posters
[1166, 1303, 1113, 1103, 2095, 117, 1292, 1132, 16300]
that I managed to put them up all by myself ,
[1115, 178, 2374, 1106, 1508, 1172, 1146, 1155, 1118, 1991, 117]
} and I feel right
[198, 1105, 178, 1631, 1268]
they look quite neat ,
[1152, 1440, 2385, 17537, 117]
they look quite neat ,
[1152, 1440, 2385, 17537, 117]
} Hi everyone ! right
[198, 20844, 2490, 106, 1268]
} So I 'm just about to tuck into a crisp sandwich . right
[198, 1177, 178, 112, 182, 1198, 1164, 1106, 189, 8474, 1154, 170, 19501, 14327, 119, 1268]
So I 'm just about to tuck into a crisp sandwich .
[1177, 178, 112, 182, 1198, 1164, 1106, 189, 8474, 1154, 170, 19501, 14327, 119]
So I 'm just about to tuck into a crisp sandwich .
[1177, 178, 112, 182, 1198, 1164, 1106, 189, 8474, 1154, 170, 19501, 14327, 119]
And I 've got some apple juice
[1105, 178, 112, 1396, 1400, 1199, 12075, 12362]
} So I thought right
[198, 1177, 178, 1354, 1268]
} this was an opportune time right
[198, 1142, 1108, 1126, 11769, 4342, 10038, 1159, 1268]
} to tell you all right
[198, 1106, 1587, 1128, 1155, 1268]
} that a couple of weeks ago I found out right
[198, 1115, 170, 2337, 1104, 2277, 2403, 178, 1276, 1149, 1268]
that I am pregnant .
[1115, 178, 1821, 6391, 119]
It 's the first week
[1122, 112, 188, 1103, 1148, 1989]
that I 've been actually able to say the words " I 'm pregnant "
[1115, 178, 112, 1396, 1151, 2140, 1682, 1106, 1474, 1103, 1734, 107, 178, 112, 182, 6391, 107]
} I found out on , <*> it was the 3rd of January . right
[198, 178, 1276, 1149, 1113, 117, 133, 115, 135, 1122, 1108, 1103, 2973, 1104, 179, 19762, 3113, 119, 1268]
} I think right
[198, 178, 1341, 1268]
} Let 's just double check that . right
[198, 1519, 112, 188, 1198, 2702, 4031, 1115, 119, 1268]
} No , excuse me , right
[198, 1185, 117, 9107, 1143, 117, 1268]
that I am pregnant .
[1115, 178, 1821, 6391, 119]
it was the fifth of January .
[1122, 1108, 1103, 3049, 1104, 179, 19762, 3113, 119]
I found out on the fifth
[178, 1276, 1149, 1113, 1103, 3049]
and that was
[1105, 1115, 1108]
because my period was late
[1272, 1139, 1669, 1108, 1523]
} As soon as I came off the pill right
[198, 1112, 1770, 1112, 178, 1338, 1228, 1103, 21822, 1268]
I found out on the fifth
[178, 1276, 1149, 1113, 1103, 3049]
my period came back pretty regularly
[1139, 1669, 1338, 1171, 2785, 4857]
} just because I knew right
[198, 1198, 1272, 178, 1450, 1268]
and I started tracking my periods
[1105, 178, 1408, 10066, 1139, 6461]
the pregnancy was something
[1103, 10203, 1108, 1380]
} and I know right
[198, 1105, 178, 1221, 1268]
the pregnancy was something
[1103, 10203, 1108, 1380]
that it helps if you 've been tracking your period
[1115, 1122, 6618, 1191, 1128, 112, 1396, 1151, 10066, 1240, 1669]
that I am pregnant .
[1115, 178, 1821, 6391, 119]
} because my initial reaction was , right
[198, 1272, 1139, 3288, 3943, 1108, 117, 1268]
because my initial reaction was ,
[1272, 1139, 3288, 3943, 1108, 117]
And for the first few days / couple of weeks I felt really anxious , really scared , really worried ,
[1105, 1111, 1103, 1148, 1374, 1552, 120, 2337, 1104, 2277, 178, 1464, 1541, 11841, 117, 1541, 5528, 117, 1541, 4472, 117]
I 'm not old enough for this .
[178, 112, 182, 1136, 1385, 1536, 1111, 1142, 119]
I 'm not grown up enough
[178, 112, 182, 1136, 4215, 1146, 1536]
And for the first few days / couple of weeks I felt really anxious , really scared , really worried ,
[1105, 1111, 1103, 1148, 1374, 1552, 120, 2337, 1104, 2277, 178, 1464, 1541, 11841, 117, 1541, 5528, 117, 1541, 4472, 117]
You feel like you 're prepared ,
[1128, 1631, 1176, 1128, 112, 1231, 4029, 117]
} you know , right
[198, 1128, 1221, 117, 1268]
} We have been for years , right
[198, 1195, 1138, 1151, 1111, 1201, 117, 1268]
We have been for years ,
[1195, 1138, 1151, 1111, 1201, 117]
} but I do n't know what it is . right
[198, 1133, 178, 1202, 183, 112, 189, 1221, 1184, 1122, 1110, 119, 1268]
} As soon as I found out right
[198, 1112, 1770, 1112, 178, 1276, 1149, 1268]
You feel like you 're prepared ,
[1128, 1631, 1176, 1128, 112, 1231, 4029, 117]
} I 'm like right
[198, 178, 112, 182, 1176, 1268]
I just went back to like a 14 year old girl .
[178, 1198, 1355, 1171, 1106, 1176, 170, 1489, 1214, 1385, 1873, 119]
" oh my god , what am I gon na tell my mom ?
[107, 9294, 1139, 5540, 117, 1184, 1821, 178, 1301, 1179, 9468, 1587, 1139, 4113, 136]
I just went back to like a 14 year old girl .
[178, 1198, 1355, 1171, 1106, 1176, 170, 1489, 1214, 1385, 1873, 119]
So really I was just very very overwhelmed and anxious
[1177, 1541, 178, 1108, 1198, 1304, 1304, 14127, 1105, 11841]
And for the first few days / couple of weeks I felt really anxious , really scared , really worried ,
[1105, 1111, 1103, 1148, 1374, 1552, 120, 2337, 1104, 2277, 178, 1464, 1541, 11841, 117, 1541, 5528, 117, 1541, 4472, 117]
It was quite a shock
[1122, 1108, 2385, 170, 4900]
It was quite a shock
[1122, 1108, 2385, 170, 4900]
It 's life-changing ,
[1122, 112, 188, 1297, 118, 4787, 117]
and so for the first couple of weeks that 's all
[1105, 1177, 1111, 1103, 1148, 2337, 1104, 2277, 1115, 112, 188, 1155]
and so for the first couple of weeks that 's all
[1105, 1177, 1111, 1103, 1148, 2337, 1104, 2277, 1115, 112, 188, 1155]
was how life-changing it was
[1108, 1293, 1297, 118, 4787, 1122, 1108]
And for the first few days / couple of weeks I felt really anxious , really scared , really worried ,
[1105, 1111, 1103, 1148, 1374, 1552, 120, 2337, 1104, 2277, 178, 1464, 1541, 11841, 117, 1541, 5528, 117, 1541, 4472, 117]
I then started to talk to people about it ,
[178, 1173, 1408, 1106, 2037, 1106, 1234, 1164, 1122, 117]
} And , I 'm not really sure what I 'm trying to say . right
[198, 1105, 117, 178, 112, 182, 1136, 1541, 1612, 1184, 178, 112, 182, 1774, 1106, 1474, 119, 1268]
And , I 'm not really sure what I 'm trying to say .
[1105, 117, 178, 112, 182, 1136, 1541, 1612, 1184, 178, 112, 182, 1774, 1106, 1474, 119]
} but I decided right
[198, 1133, 178, 1879, 1268]
that I am pregnant .
[1115, 178, 1821, 6391, 119]
I do want to document this some way ,
[178, 1202, 1328, 1106, 5830, 1142, 1199, 1236, 117]
} At first I was like , right
[198, 1120, 1148, 178, 1108, 1176, 117, 1268]
} I do n't need to copy it on YouTube right
[198, 178, 1202, 183, 112, 189, 1444, 1106, 5633, 1122, 1113, 1128, 25098, 1162, 1268]
I do want to document this some way ,
[178, 1202, 1328, 1106, 5830, 1142, 1199, 1236, 117]
but I definitely wanted to document this in some kind of video form ,
[1133, 178, 5397, 1458, 1106, 5830, 1142, 1107, 1199, 1912, 1104, 1888, 1532, 117]
just because it 's such a huge thing .
[1198, 1272, 1122, 112, 188, 1216, 170, 3321, 1645, 119]
I do want to document this some way ,
[178, 1202, 1328, 1106, 5830, 1142, 1199, 1236, 117]
} because <*> I did start to watch videos of people 's first few weeks , right
[198, 1272, 133, 115, 135, 178, 1225, 1838, 1106, 2824, 6581, 1104, 1234, 112, 188, 1148, 1374, 2277, 117, 1268]
} when I first found out , right
[198, 1165, 178, 1148, 1276, 1149, 117, 1268]
But I did want to document my first trimester to an extent ,
[1133, 178, 1225, 1328, 1106, 5830, 1139, 1148, 13373, 12831, 1106, 1126, 6102, 117]
} maybe because I was n't in a great headspace , right
[198, 2654, 1272, 178, 1108, 183, 112, 189, 1107, 170, 1632, 4075, 12204, 117, 1268]
but again , <*> that just frightened me ,
[1133, 1254, 117, 133, 115, 135, 1115, 1198, 10551, 1143, 117]
} and I did n't feel excited . right
[198, 1105, 178, 1225, 183, 112, 189, 1631, 7215, 119, 1268]
which again was because everyone was just saying how awful they felt , how excited they were ,
[1134, 1254, 1108, 1272, 2490, 1108, 1198, 2157, 1293, 9684, 1152, 1464, 117, 1293, 7215, 1152, 1127, 117]
} The thought right
[198, 1103, 1354, 1268]
The thought
[1103, 1354]
I felt worried .
[178, 1464, 4472, 119]
I cried
[178, 6104]
I cried
[178, 6104]
} I mean right
[198, 178, 1928, 1268]
that I am pregnant .
[1115, 178, 1821, 6391, 119]
you , you feel quite bad
[1128, 117, 1128, 1631, 2385, 2213]
you , you feel quite bad
[1128, 117, 1128, 1631, 2385, 2213]
you , you feel quite bad
[1128, 117, 1128, 1631, 2385, 2213]
} you know , right
[198, 1128, 1221, 117, 1268]
} I – right
[198, 178, 782, 1268]
you know ,
[1128, 1221, 117]
} I know right
[198, 178, 1221, 1268]
and now , <*> I 've kind of accepted .
[1105, 1208, 117, 133, 115, 135, 178, 112, 1396, 1912, 1104, 3134, 119]
you , you feel quite bad
[1128, 117, 1128, 1631, 2385, 2213]
And I am happy to tell people ,
[1105, 178, 1821, 2816, 1106, 1587, 1234, 117]
} when you 're trying to get your head around it , right
[198, 1165, 1128, 112, 1231, 1774, 1106, 1243, 1240, 1246, 1213, 1122, 117, 1268]
it 's very daunting
[1122, 112, 188, 1304, 5358, 14597]
and you just feel awful
[1105, 1128, 1198, 1631, 9684]
and you just feel awful
[1105, 1128, 1198, 1631, 9684]
The thought <*> makes me want to burst into tears .
[1103, 1354, 133, 115, 135, 2228, 1143, 1328, 1106, 6007, 1154, 3632, 119]
The thought <*> makes me want to burst into tears .
[1103, 1354, 133, 115, 135, 2228, 1143, 1328, 1106, 6007, 1154, 3632, 119]
you , you feel quite bad
[1128, 117, 1128, 1631, 2385, 2213]
So that also then helped me to make the decision
[1177, 1115, 1145, 1173, 2375, 1143, 1106, 1294, 1103, 2383]
So that also then helped me to make the decision
[1177, 1115, 1145, 1173, 2375, 1143, 1106, 1294, 1103, 2383]
but I 'm probably going to do it , like , with hindsight ,
[1133, 178, 112, 182, 1930, 1280, 1106, 1202, 1122, 117, 1176, 117, 1114, 24856, 18883, 117]
so I check in every now and again
[1177, 178, 4031, 1107, 1451, 1208, 1105, 1254]
but I 'm probably going to do it , like , with hindsight ,
[1133, 178, 112, 182, 1930, 1280, 1106, 1202, 1122, 117, 1176, 117, 1114, 24856, 18883, 117]
But in terms <*> I 'm not gon na vlog
[1133, 1107, 2538, 133, 115, 135, 178, 112, 182, 1136, 1301, 1179, 9468, 191, 13791]
of if I am sick
[1104, 1191, 178, 1821, 4809]
But in terms <*> I 'm not gon na vlog
[1133, 1107, 2538, 133, 115, 135, 178, 112, 182, 1136, 1301, 1179, 9468, 191, 13791]
But in terms <*> I 'm not gon na vlog
[1133, 1107, 2538, 133, 115, 135, 178, 112, 182, 1136, 1301, 1179, 9468, 191, 13791]
I would n't want to vlog
[178, 1156, 183, 112, 189, 1328, 1106, 191, 13791]
whilst I feel like that
[5994, 178, 1631, 1176, 1115]
} And I just think right
[198, 1105, 178, 1198, 1341, 1268]
But in terms <*> I 'm not gon na vlog
[1133, 1107, 2538, 133, 115, 135, 178, 112, 182, 1136, 1301, 1179, 9468, 191, 13791]
it did n't help me seeing people at their worst at the very beginning ,
[1122, 1225, 183, 112, 189, 1494, 1143, 3195, 1234, 1120, 1147, 4997, 1120, 1103, 1304, 2150, 117]
but I 'm probably going to do it , like , with hindsight ,
[1133, 178, 112, 182, 1930, 1280, 1106, 1202, 1122, 117, 1176, 117, 1114, 24856, 18883, 117]
I decided to wait a few weeks
[178, 1879, 1106, 3074, 170, 1374, 2277]
} so I think right
[198, 1177, 178, 1341, 1268]
I decided to wait a few weeks
[178, 1879, 1106, 3074, 170, 1374, 2277]
that I am pregnant .
[1115, 178, 1821, 6391, 119]
} I went – right
[198, 178, 1355, 782, 1268]
I am waiting for my first midwife appointment .
[178, 1821, 2613, 1111, 1139, 1148, 2286, 22267, 5516, 119]
} because the NHS says right
[198, 1272, 1103, 183, 9524, 1867, 1268]
I booked the doctors ,
[178, 18951, 1103, 8114, 117]
I booked the doctors ,
[178, 18951, 1103, 8114, 117]
but that was a waste of time
[1133, 1115, 1108, 170, 5671, 1104, 1159]
and I felt quite bad
[1105, 178, 1464, 2385, 2213]
but that was a waste of time
[1133, 1115, 1108, 170, 5671, 1104, 1159]
Because in my area you 'd have to self-refer ,
[1272, 1107, 1139, 1298, 1128, 112, 173, 1138, 1106, 2191, 118, 5991, 117]
I booked the doctors ,
[178, 18951, 1103, 8114, 117]
but I have been tracking
[1133, 178, 1138, 1151, 10066]
but I have been tracking
[1133, 178, 1138, 1151, 10066]
I 've got an app
[178, 112, 1396, 1400, 1126, 12647]
I 've got an app
[178, 112, 1396, 1400, 1126, 12647]
} you know , right
[198, 1128, 1221, 117, 1268]
I 've got an app
[178, 112, 1396, 1400, 1126, 12647]
and have an estimated due date ,
[1105, 1138, 1126, 3555, 1496, 2236, 117]
} In terms of symptoms , <*> I have n't felt the best , right
[198, 1107, 2538, 1104, 8006, 117, 133, 115, 135, 178, 1138, 183, 112, 189, 1464, 1103, 1436, 117, 1268]
} I mean right
[198, 178, 1928, 1268]
that I am pregnant .
[1115, 178, 1821, 6391, 119]
} I 've definitely struggled on some days right
[198, 178, 112, 1396, 5397, 6325, 1113, 1199, 1552, 1268]
but I have been able to get through it .
[1133, 178, 1138, 1151, 1682, 1106, 1243, 1194, 1122, 119]
} The biggest thing for me is I have lost – right
[198, 1103, 4583, 1645, 1111, 1143, 1110, 178, 1138, 1575, 782, 1268]
that I am pregnant .
[1115, 178, 1821, 6391, 119]
I dipped ,
[178, 13916, 117]
I dipped ,
[178, 13916, 117]
There 's nothing
[1175, 112, 188, 1720]
} I do n't have particular aversions to things , right
[198, 178, 1202, 183, 112, 189, 1138, 2440, 170, 12475, 1116, 1106, 1614, 117, 1268]
I do n't have particular aversions to things ,
[178, 1202, 183, 112, 189, 1138, 2440, 170, 12475, 1116, 1106, 1614, 117]
I do n't feel really sick
[178, 1202, 183, 112, 189, 1631, 1541, 4809]
There 's nothing
[1175, 112, 188, 1720]
But there 's things

you learn about more than just individual events
[1128, 3858, 1164, 1167, 1190, 1198, 2510, 1958]
You absorb a large quantity of information
[1128, 18055, 170, 1415, 11978, 1104, 1869]
by listening to and participating in discussions ,

[1128, 18055, 170, 1415, 11978, 1104, 1869]
In the process , your brain gathers details
[1107, 1103, 1965, 117, 1240, 3575, 8422, 1116, 4068]
however , one of the easiest places <*> is inside a classroom ,

Concepts can be complex and abstract , like justice , or more concrete , like types of birds .
[8550, 1169, 1129, 2703, 1105, 11108, 117, 1176, 5299, 117, 1137, 1167, 5019, 117, 1176, 3322, 1104, 4939, 119]
In psychology , for example , Piaget ’s stages of development are abstract concepts .
[1107, 8874, 117, 1111, 1859, 117, 185, 1465, 16609, 787, 188, 5251, 1104, 1718, 1132, 11108, 8550, 119]
Some concepts , like tolerance , are agreed upon by many people ,
[1199, 8550, 117, 1176, 15745, 117, 1132, 2675, 1852, 1118, 1242, 1234, 117]

In this way , concepts touch every aspect of our lives ,
[1107, 1142, 1236, 117, 8550, 2828, 1451, 7631, 1104, 1412, 2491, 117]
from our many daily routines to the guiding principles behind the way
[1121, 1412, 1242, 3828, 27393, 1106, 1103, 18111, 6551, 1481, 1103, 1236]
} Another technique <*> is the identification of prototypes for the concepts right
[198, 1330, 5531, 133, 115, 135, 1110, 1103, 9117, 1104, 22544, 1111, 1103, 8550, 1268]

used by your brain
[1215, 1118, 1240, 3575]
is the identification of prototypes for the concepts
[1110, 1103, 9117, 1104, 22544, 1111, 1103, 8550]
Concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information , images , ideas , or memories , such as life experiences .
[8550, 1132, 6788, 1137, 23291, 1116, 1104, 13633, 1869, 117, 4351, 117, 4133, 117, 1137, 5628, 117, 1216, 1112, 1297, 5758, 119]
A prototype is the best example or representation of a concept .
[170, 8933, 1110, 1103, 1436, 1859, 1137, 6368, 1104, 170, 3400, 119]
For example , for the category of civil disobedience , your prototype could be Rosa Parks .
[1111, 1859, 117, 1111, 1103, 4370, 1104, 2987, 4267, 7301, 18100, 117, 1240, 8933, 1180, 1129, 187, 9275, 8412, 119]

Mohandas Gandhi served as a nonviolent force for independence for India
[182, 10559, 16724, 1116, 176, 5709, 3031, 1462, 1112, 170, 1664, 17417, 13147, 2049, 1111, 4574, 1111, 1107, 7168]

I get switched around --
[178, 1243, 6759, 1213, 118, 118]
to cover some residents
[1106, 2267, 1199, 3159]
I 'm on my general nuclear medicine rotation this week .
[178, 112, 182, 1113, 1139, 1704, 4272, 5182, 9967, 1142, 1989, 119]
So so far this morning I 've just read a few studies <*> of general nuclear medicine
[1177, 1177, 1677, 1142, 2106, 178, 112, 1396, 1198, 2373, 170, 1374, 2527, 133, 115, 135, 1104, 1704, 4272, 5182]

because a lot of stuff takes time
[1272, 170, 1974, 1104, 4333, 2274, 1159]
for the radio tracers to go into the body or the specific organ
[1111, 1103, 2070, 8332, 1733, 1106, 1301, 1154, 1103, 1404, 1137, 1103, 2747, 5677]

So I 've done three lymphoscintigraphies .
[1177, 178, 112, 1396, 1694, 1210, 181, 25698, 2155, 16430, 3121, 15241, 1905, 119]
For lymphoscintigraphies we basically inject technetium in skin
[1111, 181, 25698, 2155, 16430, 3121, 15241, 1905, 1195, 11519, 1107, 16811, 13395, 6097, 3656, 1107, 2241]
} and after we inject right
[198, 1105, 1170, 1195, 1107, 16811, 1268]
For lymphoscintigraphies we basically inject technetium in skin

we wait about 15 - 20 minutes , maybe up to an hour ,
[1195, 3074, 1164, 1405, 118, 1406, 1904, 117, 2654, 1146, 1106, 1126, 2396, 117]
and wait for that radio tracer to travel to the closest lymph node
[1105, 3074, 1111, 1115, 2070, 8332, 1197, 1106, 3201, 1106, 1103, 7064, 181, 25698, 14372]

and then they will try to find the lymph node
[1105, 1173, 1152, 1209, 2222, 1106, 1525, 1103, 181, 25698, 14372]

and take that one out as well
[1105, 1321, 1115, 1141, 1149, 1112, 1218]
So I 've done three lymphoscintigraphies .
[1177, 178, 112, 1396, 1694, 1210, 181, 25698, 2155, 16430, 3121, 15241, 1905, 119]

Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-cased were not used when initializing BertModel: ['cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
